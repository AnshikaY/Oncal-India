  <h2><u>Welcome to Oncal India!</u></h2> <br>
  <p> We bring to you this fully online store which lets you sell and buy local stuff from the comfort of your home.
  Oncal India, an <b>on</b>line lo<b>cal</b> store enables the seller to list out items to sell for the buyers in
  their area and connects them to the buyers looking to buy the listed things. We take care of both seller's and buyer's satisfaction.<br>
    <p> And not just that, we also intend to act against the problems which are being born out of ongoing Covid'19 pandemic.
      Small business owners are the worst hit by it and hence we look to empower them by prioritizing their products to be sold.
      To know more about us, visit <a href="bridgingo_Oncal_about.html">About</a>. <br>
    Below listed are the people we intend to support: </p>
  </p>
</div> <br><br>

<div class="flex-parent">
<div class="Introduction">
  <h3> Small business owners </h3>
  <p> Perhaps nothing has been hit harder than the regionâ€™s small businesses.
    Many of the owners of these small, independent restaurants, breweries
    and other companies, had overcome long odds to setup them. The ongoing pandemic has
    now crippled them.  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="Introduction">
    <h3> Women entrepreneurs </h3>
    <p> Women own 20 percent of micro enterprises, 5 percent small enterprises, and less
       than 3 percent medium enterprises in India and economic slowdowns and pandemic-induced
       shutdowns have hit them hard.   </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Introduction">
      <h3> Self-help groups </h3>
      <p> The lockdown mandate has dwindled the demand of their products. Their problems
        are largely logistic and of procurement. Things like tailoring work, milk business,
        small shops have stopped operating or discontinued work. </p>
      </div>
    </div> <br>

    <div class="flex-parent">
      <div class="Introduction">
        <h3> Domestic manufacturers </h3>
        <p> While allowing employees to work from home is seen widely as a humane approach by business leaders,
        the manufacturing industry is not only finding it hard to adopt it but is also conceptually against it as a practice.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Introduction">
          <h3> Local service providers </h3>
          <p> The basis of service providing has been the way they contact and connect with their customers.
             Infact this is the only thing that becomes a deciding factor for customers to select among options.
             But with lockdown and no social contact they have been hit hard.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Introduction">
            <h3> Local vendors </h3>
            <p>  The current lockdown has made local vendors, who already live on the
              margins, more vulnerable. Among them, street vendors are the worst hit by the lockdown,
              since they are more likely to face a loss of livelihood for an entire household. </p>
            </div>
        </div> <br><br>

<div class="intro">
  <p> As much as we are looking forward to support the above mentioned categories of sellers, we are also determined to make buying experience fruitful for our buyers.
    We intend to overcome problems like unavailibility of products and price-hike due to lockdown.

    So let us sell and buy <b>on</b>line and lo<b>cal</b> because that is how a community grows. <br> <em>'Together we can'</em>. </p>
