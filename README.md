# Oncal-India-
This is a website which promotes online but local trade owing to deglobalization due to corona pandemic. It has been built as a solution to the problem statement on the theme of ‘ATMA NIRBHAR BHARAT’ provided by Bridgingo in round 2 of their National Level Hackathon - Game of Codes. I plan to develop it further through its backend.

SOLUTION CONCEPT NOTE

INTRODUCTION

According to the problem statement I have designed a website as a prototype for my solution. I have named it "Oncal India" (‘on’ comes from online and ‘cal’ comes from local).

One external CSS and four JavaScript files have been used for formatting and for all the prompts, alert and confirmation messages respectively. 


TECHNICAL DETAILS

HTML, CSS and Jaavscript have been used in this prototype. Further in the solution I intend to use django and MySQL to attach database and add more functionality using python and c++. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 
Seven webpages namely Home, About, Sell, Buy, FAQs, Feedback and Contact Us are connected to each other through a navigation bar given at the top. Home page describes the work and the main vision and goal of this solution. About page gives detailed description regarding the organization and its working. Sell page has a form for the people who want to list items to sell. Buy page has a form for the people who want to search product/service to buy. FAQs page addresses all the frequently asked questions. Feedback has a form for the people who want to convey a suggestion or feedback. Contact Us page specifies all the ways in which a person can contact the organization. 


UNIQUE FEATURES

Important fields in the forms have been marked as required and it has been made sure that only numbers can be entered in fields like phone number, zip code etc. 

Each time home page is visited, an alert message informs the user that the website uses cookies for better functioning. After submission of selling and buying forms, a prompt checks to distinguish between a robot or genuine user by asking to complete CAPTCHA. After submission of feedback form, a message simply thanks the user. 

Also about, faq, feedback and contact us panels have been created to make the solution more reliable and transparent. 

Also address of both parties has been recorded so that trading is among the immediate community and hence stays local.

FUTURE SCOPE

Apart from the functionalities already developed, additional feature that can be further incorporated is use of machine learning to sort out matching results on basis of location, in place of manual matching of addresses. 

MySQL and django can also be used together in a way to build huge database that enables a large variety of products and choices in service to be present since in coming times the selling and buying operations are more likely to turn fully online and local. Hence we need to be prepared so that no seller is hit by this and buyers don’t lack variety.

Hopefully this solution will strengthen the cause of ‘ATMA NIRBHAR BHARAT’.

Thank you!
