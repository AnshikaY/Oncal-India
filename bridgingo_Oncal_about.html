    <h1 align="center"> About us </h1> <br><br>

    <div class="intro">
    <p> We are an entirely online market place where one can buy and sell as per
      their convenience and without having to leave the comfort of their home. We promote local
      trading of products and hence pair up sellers and buyers of the same region. <br><br>

    Oncal India believes that every seller deserves to be able to go on and not face any obstacle in the
    selling process. These sellers (mostly operating on small scale) also deserve the exposure and opportunities,
    which they lack due to overshadowing by high-end companies. And so we have set forth to connect such sellers with people who are willing to buy their products.
    <br><br>

    Buyers on the other hand are hit by unavailibility of products and price-hike due to the ongoing pandemic and we intend to provide them products at reasonable cost.
    Both parties' satisfaction is our utmost goal. <br><br>

    Anyone doing business in any location in the country can get themselves registered on the platform and can directly sell articles and services of common use. They will be required to mention the service they want to provide or the product that they wish to sell upon registration and then this information will be made public.
    Similarly, sellers can use this platform to purchase goods at the ease of sitting at their home. <br><br>

    We are proud to be promoting the concepts of <em> Atma Nirbhar Bharat</em>, <em> Digital India</em> and <em> Vocal for local </em> along with creating a fruitful experience for sellers and buyers. </p>

    <p> We firmly believe that <em>'together we can'</em>. So come <a href="bridgingo_Oncal_sell.html">sell</a> and <a href="bridgingo_Oncal_buy.html">buy</a> with us.</p>
